# Creating Python DSL Generator for Azure
This application reads stack.yml file and generates a new file called azure-vm.tf. 

This is just a demo and needs to be completed.


Make sure 
- you have Python 2.7 installed on your machine
- you have pip installed on your machine (pip is Python package manager)

```bash
# pip install -r requirments.txt
# python app.py

```

After execution a file with `azure-vm.tf` will be generated. The full version of this file can be found under examples 
directory.
